The cause of death was ruled a homicide, as the victim had been shot in the head. She was clothed in ankle socks with blue and red stripes, a Camp Beverly Hills brand large blue sweater. It was estimated the victim likely died three to four weeks prior. Investigators were not able to determine if the location where the body was found was the same location that the homicide occurred.</p>\r\n<p>Investigative Genetic Genealogy was conducted and in October 2024, the victim was identified as Molly Monette Hogan.
